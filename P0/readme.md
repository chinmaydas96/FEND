# Letter to Self

Dear Future Chinmay,

So you may have some trouble with some problems as always . You knew it 
wasn't going to be easy when you start. Remember those things you read and 
promised to do at the beginning on start coding ?This path is never easy 
neither will be . But you know what to do best for yourself .

Get your mind right. Take a deep breadth and remember why you are doing 
this. What can you take away from this challenge so you can get better? 
Don't worry about how far along, or how much better, other developers and 
friends are; they all had to go through this too. May be if go this path 
you will be go far long then they ever go.

Next, take a break! Go take a walk, or go listen to batman  and the 
beautiful mind theme song. Seeing the problem with fresh eyes might do the 
trick.

Remember you like visualization and art .So remember to do draw diagrams on 
the wall and read the bookmarks .Don't let fear control your mind 
.Happiness is key for our success and always will be .So be happy and calm 
no matter what .

 

Best, 

Your past buddy ,

Chinmay
